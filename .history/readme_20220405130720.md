main.js => given an array 'arr' find the next 'n' duplicates inside that array

const arr = [3, 4, 5, 3, 6, 4, 5, -1, 2, 2];

input: n = 2;
output: 3, 4

input: n = 7;
output: 3, 4, 5, 2

Example:

main2.js => given an array 'arr' print each element 'i' with it's next 'greater than i' element. If it doesn't exist print -1

34 -> 54
23 -> 54
12 -> 54
54 -> 99
34 -> 99
99 -> -1
12 -> 43
43 -> -1
